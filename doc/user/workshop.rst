Workshop
========

This section contains a full workshop to dig inside Haka. It will introduce
most Haka concepts.

To do it, you will first need to install and setup Haka on your computer or
you can also download our Debian live based iso to directly boot with a
full environment containing Haka with all its dependencies.
